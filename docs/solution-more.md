Each of the following solutions has been proven to be effective and we hope to be helpful to you.

## Domain binding

The precondition for **Domain binding** is have completed the **Domain resolution** for Nextcloud Instance.

From the perspective of server security and subsequent maintenance considerations, the **Domain Binding** step cannot be omitted.

Nextcloud domain name binding steps:

1. Connect your Cloud Server
2. Modify [vhost configuration file](/stack-components.md#apache), change the domain name item for you
   ```text
   #### Nextcloud (LAMP) bind domain #### 

     <VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerName nextcloud.mydomain.com # modify it for you
     DocumentRoot "/data/wwwroot/Nextcloud"
     ...
     
   #### Nextcloud (LEMP) bind domain #### 

     server {
      listen 80;
      server_name    nextcloud.example.com; # modify it for you
     ...

   ```
3. Save it and restart [Web Service](/admin-services.md#apache)


## Nextcloud change domain

You can change the domain of Nextcloud by the following steps:

1. Complete the new **Domain resolution and Domain binding**
2. Modify [Nextcloud configuration file](/stack-components.html#nextcloud)
   ```
   'overwrite.cli.url' => 'nextcloud.yourdomain.com', # Set it to your new domain
   ```
3. [Restart PHP-FPM service](/admin-services.html#php-fpm)

## Nextcloud transfer

Nextcloud source code and data is in system disk by default, you can transfer them to data disk or  Object storage:

### to data disk

1. Purchase a data disk from Cloud Platform, then **attach** it to Nextcloud Server
2. Use SFTP tool to connect Server and stop service
   ```
   systemctl stop httpd
   ```
3. Create a new folder */data/wwwroot/nextcloud2* 
4. Initialize data disk, and **mount** it to *nextcloud2* folder
5. Copy all files in */data/wwwroot/nextcloud* to */data/wwwroot/nextcloud2*  
6. Modify the Nextcloud directory in  [vhost configuration file](/zh/stack-components.html#apache) 
7. Start the service
   ```
   systemctl start httpd
   ```

### to Object storage

1. Purchase Object storage from Cloud Platform, then create a new **bucket**
2. Use SFTP tool to connect Server and stop service
   ```
   systemctl stop httpd
   ```
3. Create a new folder */data/wwwroot/nextcloud2* 
4. Then **mount** it to *nextcloud2* folder
5. Copy all files in */data/wwwroot/nextcloud* to */data/wwwroot/nextcloud2*  
6. Modify the Nextcloud directory in  [vhost configuration file](/zh/stack-components.html#apache) 
7. Start the service
   ```
   systemctl start httpd
   ```
8. Set the object storage to boot automatically (different cloud platform operations)

> The **mount** command is very difficult for user, and there is a risk of copy failure if the data is exceed 10G

## Nextcloud preview and edit

Nextcloud can't preview and edit Office document itself, you need to integrate document Server service for Nextcloud to implement this function:

1. Enable the **TCP:8080** port on **[Inbound of Security Group Rule](https://support.websoft9.com/docs/faq/tech-instance.html)**
2. Log in to Nextcloud console, go to 【Apps】page
	 ![](https://libs.websoft9.com/Websoft9/DocsPicture/en/nextcloud/nextcloud-olpreview-1-websoft9.png)
3. Find the app【ONLYOFFICE】 and install it
4. Set the 【ONLYOFFICE】
   ![](https://libs.websoft9.com/Websoft9/DocsPicture/zh/nextcloud/nextcloud-setonlyoffice-websoft9.png)
   > The smear in the figure should be modified to **Internet IP**
5. Refresh the Nextcloud, test the preview and edit function of documentation
